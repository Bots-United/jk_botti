These are comment lines.  Any lines appearing before the [bot_chat] section
will be treated as comments and ignored.  Each bot chat section can have up
to 100 lines of text.  Each line is treated as a separate chat message.
Lines must be 80 characters or less.  Lines longer than 80 characters will
be truncated.  The messages in the [bot_chat] section are said randomly
during the game.  Every 30 seconds the bots will check to see if they
should speak a [bot_chat] message.  The percent of time they will speak
a chat message is set by the "bot_chat_percent" value found in the bot.cfg
file.  Bots that get a kill will speak messages from the [bot_taunt] section.
The percent of time that they will speak a taunt message is set by the
"bot_taunt_percent" value in the bot.cfg file.  Bots that get killed will
speak a message from the [bot_whine] section.  The percent of time that
they will speak a whine message is set by the "bot_whine_percent" value
in the bot.cfg file.  You can use "%n" in the [bot_chat] section if you
wish to fill in the name of the bot speaking that message.  You can use
"%n" in the [bot_taunt] section to fill in the name of the player that
was killed.  You can use "%n" in the [bot_whine] section to fill in the
name of the player that killed this bot.  You can use "%r" in any of these
sections if you want to fill in a random player name (player names are
chosen from those currently connected to the server, not from the
bot_names.txt file).  You can use "%n" or "%r" multiple times in a single
chat message if you want.

Chat messages will be modified by the BotChatHumanizer code.  This code
will swap or drop characters in the messages to make the bot appear more
human (humans make mistakes, bots don't :) ).  Bots will also occasionally
convert the chat text to all lowercase.  When filling in player's names,
bots will occasionally remove the clan tags from the name (i.e. clan tags
can be things like: "[- LPB -]", "{HQ}", "<OoO>", or "-=<Xmen>=-").  So
if the players name is "[[KLM]]BaDAzz", the bot may modify this to "BaDAzz"
or "badazz".  The percent of time the bots will remove the clan tag is
set by the "bot_chat_tag_percent" in the bot.cfg file.  The percent of
time the bots will drop characters is defined by "bot_chat_drop_percent"
in the bot.cfg file.  The percent of time the bots will swap characters
is defined by "bot_chat_swap_percent" in the bot.cfg file and the percent
of time the bots will convert messages to all lowercase is defined by the
"bot_chat_lower_percent" value in the bot.cfg file.

If you have a chat message that you don't want to have any characters
dropped or swapped in (like sending a message with a URL), you can use
a '!' character as the first character in the chat message to indicate
that this chat message should not be modified (no drops, swaps, or changing
to lowercase).  The '!' will be removed from the chat message before it
gets send to other players.
