This is 1.44β release of jk_botti, by Jussi Kivilinna <jussi.kivilinna@iki.fi>
You are free to use code for any of your needs.

jk_botti is computer gamer for multiplayer mode of Half-Life (HLDM) and has 
strong support for various submods of HLDM, modifications that change game on 
serverside but doesn't require client modifications.

jk_botti aims to:
 * Lower CPU usage compared to other HLDM bots.
 * Be more interesting opponent than other bots found there
    * More humanlike aiming, hard to keep track on target making movement changes
    * More random combat movement, random jumping, better strafing
    * Hear player footsteps/firing weapons
 * Be dedicated server targeted bot
    * Listenserver client interfaces removed.
    * Automatic waypoints creation.

jk_botti is mostly tested with Severian's, but works with original HLDM and
Bubblemod. As of version 1.40 jk_botti also supports Opposing Force.
On Severian's and Bubblemod, gluon is disabled. Bot might work
with XDM but this hasn't been tested.

One of my major goals with jk_botti was to lower CPU usage compared to
HPB_bot. I used to run Severian's server on 400Mhz Celeron (later updated 
800Mhz Athlon) and even few HPB_bots would rise cpu usage too high.
(Update: I have new server on P3-550Mhz, with default small/medium maps
like datacore/stalkyard with three bots I have see 15% cpu usage).

Trick(s) used to lower CPU usage:
 * bot_think_fps settings for limiting number of thinks per second 
   (default: 30fps)

Aiming system on jk_botti does not use currently available and latest player
locations for tracking and shooting enemy but instead use old data (level 1
bot 60ms, level 5 bot 300ms old) to guess position of player. This makes 
bot-aiming worser when player changes movement vector rapidly (jump, duck,
change strafe direction rapidly). 

jk_botti creates waypoints automatically when 'autowaypoint' setting is
enabled in config. Autowaypointing collects data on map start (weapon/item
locations) and creates new waypoints on those locations. Then jk_botti waits
real player(s) to join server and start moving around. New waypoints are
added to new places where there isn't old waypoints already present. Newly
added waypoints will not be effective until map change. This is because
jk_botti needs to recreate route matrixes with new waypoints and since this is
CPU intensive operation this can only be done on map change.

Credits:
 * Based on HPB bot 4.0 by botman.
 * Uses BotAim code by Pierre-Marie Baty.
 * Uses code from GraveBot by Caleb 'Ghoul' Delnay. (part of goal selection
   system, longjumping)

--------------------
2. What's new
--------------------
1.44β:
 * Fix rare crash when bot tries to shoot tripmine with MP5

1.43:
 * Bots do not attack breakable objects or monsters with huge amount
   of health
 * Support modifying new HL server query format

1.42:
 * [bugfix, linux] Fixed jk_botti to be linked with libm.so
 * Tweaked low level bot skills alot
    * They will be more active now (run around maps) now
    * Not too good at combat
 * Bot reaction times have been adjusted to more human scale (level 1 
   has 100ms and level 5 300ms). Times used to be less before.
 * Removal of bot_reaction_time setting.
   * You can still use bot_skill settings to adjust reaction times.
 * Internal changes
   * Compiled with newer version of gcc
   * Made large portion of inline functions uninlined as on modern 
     cpus/system small cache/code size is better than inlining 
     everything manually.

1.41:
 * Fixed low level bot aiming (were rapidly shifting right to left)
   * As result removed undocumented and broken setting 'aimangle_varitation'
 * Add skill setting updown_turn_ration, setting to make bot aim up-down worse
   than right-left.
 * Add bot endgame chatting.
   * New setting 'bot_endgame_percent', see jk_botti.cfg
   * New section [bot_endgame] in jk_botti_chat.txt
 * Bot 'write' long chat message for longer time now than short message.
 * Binaries now work on AMD K6 series CPUs.

1.40:
 * Add support for Opposing Force Deathmatch.
 * Tuned skill 1 bot to be more leet, skill 2 is now about same as old skill 1.
 * New sound system and sound tracking system, huge improvement in how bot
   finds enemy that isn't visible.
 * Bugfixes to goal selection and weapon selection, results huge improvement
   how bot work on when not given good weapons on spawn (which is typical on
   Severian's MOD). 
 * Bot now understands that it can get more ammo by picking up same weapon 
   again.
 * Bot avoids combat if it doesn't have good weapon or doesn't have enough
   health.
 * Output warning message when model given for bot creation is replaced by 
   team-balance code.
 * Changed to only check existance of player model file on listenserver 
   when creating bots.
 * Changed save order of waypoint .wpt and .matrix files so that matrix 
   doesn't have to be calculated one extra time.
 * Fixed instability problems: Replaced most of dynamic memory management 
   with static memory.
 * Fixed buggy creation of crouch waypoint over drop (it's recommended to
   replace server datacore.wpt with stock wpt since this bug hit most hard
   on datacore on one specific high traffic area).

1.30:
 * Fixed Severians MOD detection with teamplay.
 * Fixed bug with jk_botti only using first 3 letters of player/bot team name.
 * Fixed bots to get affected by weapon recoil. Somewhere along hldm releases
   recoil code was moved completely to client.dll, so now jk_botti will
   emulate client.dll function. Difference to MP5 aiming is most notable.
 * Removed hack to make bot aim worser than it should when using MP5, this 
   isn't needed anymore.
 * Added team autobalance for teamplay servers. Requirements: mp_teamplay is
   set to 1 and mp_teamlist is set with more than one team.
   * New commands 'team_balancetype' and 'team_blockedlist'. See jk_botti.cfg
     for details.
 * Disabled 'bot_conntimes 1' on listenserver.
 * NOTE: listenserver support might be completely dropped in 1.40 unless
   someone confirms that jk_botti actually works correctly on listenserver.
   Dropping support means that loading jk_botti on listenserver will be
   blocked with some error message.

1.24:
 * Rewrote min/max_bots code.
 * Increased config-file processing and bot adding speed.
 * Changed bot kicking to use 'kick # <userid>' instead of 'kick <name>'.

 * Fixed autowaypointing for paths leading from water to dry.
 * Added missing ammunition type 'ammo_9mmbox'.
 * Fixed goal selection to use wall mounted health/battery rechargers.
 * Compiled with more aggressive optimization flags. This speeds up 
   path-matrix creation.
 * Fixed output for 'kickall'-command.
 * Fixed bot not to jump when coming near edge and bot is planing to go down 
   using ladders.
 * Workaround for loading map specific config for map 'logo'. 
   Use '_jk_botti_logo.cfg' for this map. 'jk_botti_logo.cfg' is already used 
   for bot spraypaints.
 * Fixed bot always ducking when next waypoint is crouch waypoint. This 
   caused bot not be able to jump through small window with crouch waypoint 
   inside.

1.10:
 * Fixed bots to use wall mounted health/battery rechargers and buttons.
 * Fixed bots to pick up items.
 * Fixed observer mode so that bots don't hear observers anymore. This caused
   bots to get interested about observer sounds and track theim.
 * Lowered default bot lookaround/pause frequency and times.
 * Fixed autowaypointing not to place waypoints midair.
 * Fixed autowaypointing not to create impossible upwards paths.
 * Fixed autowaypointing not to create crouch waypoints if there is room to 
   stand up.
 * Old waypoint files are automatically processed to fix above 
   autowaypointing errors.
 * Lots of tweaks to autowaypointing: better handling of ladders and stairs, 
   better linking of isolated areas.
 * 'autowaypoint' is now default on.
 * New command 'show_waypoints' for viewing/aiding waypoint creation.

1.01: 
 * Fixed 'bot_conntimes 1' crashing on Windows servers.

1.00:
 * Remembers bots from config when recreating bots by min_bots/max_bots.

 * Bots don't see targets too early behind corners.

0.57:
 * Waypoint files are now compressed with zlib.

0.56:
 * Fixed waypoint matrix creation being done right on map start on win32.
 * Added command 'jk_botti kickall' for clearing server from all bots.
 * Added waypoint files for default valve maps.

0.54:
 * Fixed the way bots react to sounds. Instead of making sound enemy, bot 
   finds it's way to the interesting sound.
 * New way of computing msec for RunPlayerMove.
 * Bots don't attack respawn players too fast (delay is skill depend).
 * New skill settings: pause_time_min, pause_time_max, react_delay_min[0-2],
   react_delay_max[0-2], weaponchange_rate_min, weaponchange_rate_max.

0.53:
 * Tweaked bot behavior now with fixed reaction times. Fixed bots see better.

 * Tweaked down MP5 and crossbow aiming.
 * New setting to tweak down aim skill for specific weapons (aim_speed).
 * Bot chat is logged to server logs now.

   for loop causing weapons last in list to be used a lot less than
   weapon first in the list.
 * Added separate frame timer for aiming.
 * Multiple bots don't get same name anymore when using [lvlX] tags.

   height and distance.
 * Waypoint matrix is now calculated over time on first minutes after map 
   change with max 10ms time slices.
